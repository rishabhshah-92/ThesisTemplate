	Abstract = {This study presents land-use regression (LUR) models for submicron particulate matter (PM{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) components from an urban area. Models are presented for mass concentrations of inorganic species (SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, NH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), organic aerosol (OA) factors, and total PM{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. OA is source-apportioned using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of data collected from aerosol mass spectrometry deployed on a mobile laboratory. PMF yielded a three-factor solution: cooking OA (COA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). This study represents the first time that LUR has been applied to source-resolved OA factors. We sampled a roughly 20 km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} area of West Oakland, California, USA, over 1 month (mid-July to mid-August, 2017). The road network of the sampling domain was comprehensively sampled each day using a randomized driving route to minimize temporal and spatial bias. Mobile measurements were aggregated both spatially and temporally for use as discrete spatial observations for LUR model building. LUR model performance was highest for those species with more spatial variability (primary OA factors: COA {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.80, HOA {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.67) and lowest for secondary inorganic species (SO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.47, NH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} = 0.43) that were more spatially homogeneous. Notably, the stepwise selective LUR algorithm largely selected predictors for primary OA factors that correspond to the associated land-use categories (e.g., cooking land-use variables were selected in cooking-related PM models). This finding appears to be robust, as we demonstrate the predictive link between land-use variables and the corresponding source-resolved PM{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} components through a subsampling analysis.},

@article{Shah2018,
	Abstract = {Abstract. We investigated spatial and temporal patterns in concentration and composition of sub-micron particulate matter (PM1) in Oakland, California in the summer of 2017 using an aerosol mass spectrometer mounted in a mobile laboratory. We performed ∼160 hours of mobile sampling in the city over a 20-day period. Measurements are compared for three adjacent neighborhoods with distinct land uses: a central business district (downtown), a residential district (West Oakland), and a major shipping port. The average organic aerosol (OA) concentration is 5.3$\mu$gm{\&}minus;3 and contributes ∼50{\%} of the PM1 mass. OA concentrations in downtown are, on average, 1.5$\mu$gm{\&}minus;3 higher than in West Oakland and Port. We decomposed OA into three factors using positive matrix factorization: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA; 20{\%} average contribution), cooking OA (COA; 25{\%}) and semi-volatile oxidized OA (SV-OOA; 55{\%}). The collective 45{\%} contribution from primary OA (HOA + COA) emphasizes the importance of primary emissions in Oakland. The dominant source of primary OA shifts from HOA-rich in the morning to COA-rich after lunch time. COA in downtown is consistently higher than West Oakland and Port due to a large number of restaurants. HOA exhibits variability in space and time. Morning-time HOA concentration in downtown is twice that in Port, but Port HOA increases more than two-fold during mid-day, likely because trucking activity at the Port peaks at that time. Despite the expectation of being spatially uniform, SV-OOA also exhibits spatial differences. Morning-time SV-OOA in downtown is roughly 25{\%} (∼0.6$\mu$gm{\&}minus;3) higher than the rest of Oakland. Even as the entire domain approaches a more uniform photo-chemical state in the afternoon, downtown SV-OOA remains statistically higher than West Oakland and Port, suggesting that downtown is a microenvironment with higher photochemical activity. Higher concentrations of particulate sulfate (also of secondary origin) with no direct sources in Oakland further reflect higher photochemical activity in downtown. A combination of several factors (poor ventilation of air masses in street canyons, higher concentrations of precursor gases, higher concentrations of the hydroxyl radical) likely result in the proposed high photochemical activity in downtown. Lastly, through Van Krevelen analysis of elemental ratios (H/C, O/C) of the OA, we show that OA in Oakland is more chemically reduced than several other urban areas. This underscores the importance of primary emissions in Oakland. We also show that mixing of oceanic air masses with these primary emissions in Oakland is an important processing mechanism that governs the overall OA composition in Oakland. The findings of this study are important because the pollutants we find contributing the most to OA variability, both of primary and secondary origin, are ubiquitous in other urban locations.},

Thank you for downloading my LaTeX Thesis template.

Before you can use this template, you must make sure of the following:
1. You must have a PDF reader installed on your machine. On a Mac, "Preview" is the default PDF reader. On Windows, if you don't have a PDF reader, you can download Foxit PDF reader for free here: https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/
2. You must have LaTeX installed on your machine. The best way to do this is by installing the MiKTeX bundle from https://miktex.org/download. This will install the base LaTeX engine, as well as some TeX editors on your machine.

Let's test if a PDF reader installed correctly on your machine: in the ThesisTemplate folder you downloaded, open the "TemplateOutput.pdf" file. It should open in your default PDF reader.

Let's test whether LaTeX installed correctly or not:
1. Make sure the ThesisTemplate folder is entirely downloaded on your local machine. It does not matter if you place it on your desktop, or your downloads folder, or wherever.

2. If you have a Mac, double-click the "MAC_MakeThesis.sh" file ("WIN_MakeThesis.bat" for Windows). A Terminal/Command Line window should open up at this point and you will start seeing several lines of code auto-scrolling.

3. If you have never installed/run LaTeX before today, the first execution of the MakeThesis command might take a while depending on your Internet connection. This is the only time this template will require an Internet connection, because it needs to download several LaTeX packages such as math, chemistry, etc. If everything works fine, subsequent executions of the MakeThesis command will not require an Internet connection.

4. If the MakeThesis command is able to run successfully, several things should happen:
- the Terminal/Command Line window should auto-close
- a new PDF file called "MyThesis.pdf" should be generated in the ThesisTemplate folder, and should also auto-open.

If all of this works, you're all set with regards to installation. You are now ready to start editing this template to make your own thesis!
